# ESO_ZBS_APIcreator
Script to build an api definition file from the dump file provided at esoui in the format specified by Zerobrane Studio to provide autocomplete functionality and tooltips for the ESO Api in ZBS
Updated API maker but the regex is sloppy and the file produced has some errant brackets and commas floating around. I cleaned it up with find and replace in notepad plus plus and am committing the cleaned up and working api definition file as ESOAPI.lua
